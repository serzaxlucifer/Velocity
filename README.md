# Velocity Movie Recommender Library

This repository contains code of our implementation of different recommendation strategies, and papers. 
More coming soon!

We recommend using a docker container to run these codes. Our exact configuration is given in the dockerfile provided. To make sure all Python Libraries are compatible, we recommend using the official NVIDIA Pytorch Image (nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3) to build the container. After that, all the codes should run it. However, you will need to match the comptabile NVIDIA Driver version and CUDA version on your system.
